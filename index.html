    <h2 class="aboutme"> <font color="white">Over six years in the creative industry</h2></font>
    <p class="me1">My name is <b>Abdulmumin Ahmed</b>, I am a student at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria.
        I am a skilled web developer and presenting unique projects.
       <br> I work with both large scale and individual businesses, and i always find a great approach to the tasks given to me.
         I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. <br>
     My interest in web development started back in 2012 when i decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes. Turns out hacking together a <br> custom reblog button 
     taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! Let's not forget Graphics designing too.
    </p>
    <p class="me1">
      Fast foward to today, and i've had the privilege of working with businesses like<font color="white"><b>Nature Fresh</b></font> <b>(A popular skincare brand)</b><br>
      My main focus is creating and designing websites for companies, individuals, commercial businesses,<br> Schools and other business enterprises.

       I have worked for over different businesses, including companies, blogs <br> and small-scale stores.
       Currently, my team is being formed so i work on projects alone pending the time it will take to form a team.
