    <h2 class="aboutme"> <font color="white">Over six years in the creative industry</h2></font>
    <p class="me1">My name is <b>Abdulmumin Ahmed</b>, I am a student of the University of Ilorin, Nigeria.
        I am a skilled web developer and graphic designer presenting unique projects.
       <br> I work with both large scale and individual businesses, and i always find a great approach to the tasks given to me.
         I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. <br>
     My interest in web development started back in 2012 when i decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes. Turns out hacking together a <br> custom reblog button 
     taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! Let's not forget Graphics designing too.
     Graphics designing has always been one of the easiest skill that i know, there's no doubt that
     i am one of the best designer out there.
    </p>
    <p class="me1">
      Fast foward to today, and i've had the privilege of working with <font color="white"><b>Dangote</b></font> <b>(Africa's richest man)</b><br>
      My main focus is creating and designing websites alongside with banners and logos for companies, individuals, commercial businesses,<br> Schools and other business enterprises.

       I've worked as a team with different groups in managing and designing their websites and i've also worked alone. Majority of
       the projects that i work on, i do them alone and not with some group of people but some companies require people to work with their team.

 projects today and let's build you something great. I work for both local and international organisations, like the local

     with many designing tools. <br> Not limited to that only, I also give career advices on what
     to do and what not to do. I teach people how to make money online,<br> what keywords to use, what platforms to join, and also what programs to attend. <p class="me1">
     My teaching techniques are very unique and standard. My students must build and publish their own portfolio before they get certified. <br>
     Over 200 students have graduated from my lesson, and they now have their own personal portfolio and different websites which <br> they are earning cool money from.
     Some of them own blogs, some of them own online shopping sites, and many more. If you are ready to enrol your kids, <br> I am ready to teach them. <br><br><br>
